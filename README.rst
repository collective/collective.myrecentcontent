collective.myrecentcontent
==========================

This package provides a viewlet that renders a dropdown menu of links
to content the current user has recently acted upon.  This is intended
to be used with `plone.app.toolbar
<https://github.com/plone/plone.app.toolbar>`_ to provide users quick
access to the content they are most likely to want to access.
